### `dodgem start`

Begin the bumping process - you will be prompted for a target and an interval.

Target can be all of your trades _or_ your oldest trade.

All trades is most effective when you have a variety of different active trades - this will bump _all_ of your trades one by one every interval. Oldest trade is most effective when you have lots of duplicate trades and you want to saturate the market - this will bump only your _oldest_ trade every interval.

Interval is the amount of time to wait between bumping. It is recommended to have _atleast_ a 15 minute interval when bumping all trades to prevent bumping too frequently and hitting the 15 minute cooldown timer. When bumping the oldest trade it is recommended to use the following calculation `(15 / amountOfTrades) = interval`.
